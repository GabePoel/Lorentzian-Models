# Lorentzian Models
Machine learning models for Peak Finder backend.

## Installing

Just run the following to install directly from this repository.

```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/GabePoel/Lorentzian-Models#egg=lorentzian_models --user
```

The download and installation may take a while because the trained models are rather chunky. If you want, you can choose to install it *_not_* as a user if you're that kind of person and like living on the edge.
